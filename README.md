# Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction




# Heart Disease Risk Prediction System

This project is an interactive machine learning web application built with **Streamlit** that predicts the risk of heart disease based on user inputs. The model is powered by an **XGBoost classifier** and offers **explainable AI insights** using **SHAP values**, making the predictions transparent and easy to interpret.



## Features

- Predicts **heart disease risk** based on 13 medical features.
- Displays **risk level** categorized from *Very Low* to *Very High*.
- Built using a high-performing **XGBoost model** with ~99% accuracy.
- Includes **SHAP visualizations** for feature importance and model explainability.
- Clean, interactive **Streamlit UI** for user-friendly experience.
- Real-time model inference and interpretation.


## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib**
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**



##  Dataset

- The dataset is sourced from the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**.
- It includes features like age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc.
